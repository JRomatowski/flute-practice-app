# Project Description:

This website is RP Diet App or My Fitness Pal but for instrumental practice.  Track practice frequency, length, etc and display it in cool graphs to keep people motivated.

# Tech Stack:
- Frontend - React.js
- Backend - Django/Python
- Database - postgresql

# User Stories:

- As a user, I want to a place to store my practice data, and keep it safe
- As a user, I want to be able to track all of my students information in one place, rather than how I currently do it in multiple places
- As a user, I want to be able to store lesson notes and then email parents a summary
- As a user, I want students to be able to log in and be held accountable for their practicing this way
- As a user, I need this app to be *very* fast.  Faster than using google docs.  Students still feel distracted when they see me on my phone, regardless of whether I tell them what I am doing or not.
